# How to contribute

To contribute to the PayEx Development Guidelines, there's just a few things you need to know.

## Getting Started

* Read and make sure you agree with the [Code of Conduct](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md)
* Make sure you have a [GitHub account](https://github.com/signup/free)
* Then, you have three options:
    1. Submit a ticket for your issue, assuming one does not already exist.
        * Clearly describe the issue including steps to reproduce when it is a bug.
          * Make sure you fill in the earliest version that you know has the issue.
    2. Directly edit the file you want to change on GitHub
    3. Fork the repository on GitHub

If you choose option 3, then please read on.

## Making Changes

* Create a new branch from where you want to base your work.
  * This is usually the `master` branch.
  * Please avoid working directly on the `master` branch.
* Make commits of logical units.
* Check for unnecessary whitespace with `git diff --check` before committing.
* Make sure your commit messages are in the proper format.
* Push the branch to your forked repository.
* Submit a pull request for the pushed branch.
